# 📜 About
**Legacy4J** is a mod about nostalgia of old 4J Studios Minecraft Legacy Edition. The main objective of this mod is remake every aspect of [Legacy Console Edition](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Legacy_Console_Edition) in 1:1 for Java Edition versions, adding its exclusive features, and bringing it to modern versions.

This includes an accurate controller support, the control tooltips, the crafting menu, the creative flight, the gamma shader, the scaling, the HUD, and more!
